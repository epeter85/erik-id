      <h2>WHO AM I</h2>
       <p>An <b>interactive developer</b> and <b>technical lead</b> with over 10 years of advertising agency experience. I began my digital career as a designer and quickly found my calling as a developer. My passion is building rich experiences that not only press the latest technologiesÂ but also are clean, functional and user friendly.</p>
       <p>If you are looking for a developer that understands technology, has a background in design and video, and can execute ideas that sizzle, we should talk.</p>
